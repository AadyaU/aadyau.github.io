            Everyone's unique, from head to toe. I know I have a lot of interests and hobbies, but that's not all that defines me as a person. So instead of just reading about how I love basketball and reading, I thought I'd show another side of me: my nicknames!

      <p>I love all my friends, both in-person and online. They've all seen different sides of me, and I love seeing all the sides of them. As the days I spend with them pass by, we see each other finding our passions and interests. With this given, my friends decide to give me nicknames based on things I do and pictures I pose in. Here are a few of my favorites and the backstory behind them!</p>

      <p class="list">1. Lamp (from this emoji: üõãÔ∏è)</p>
      <p>This one came from my gorgeous friend Sofia, who I have affectionately called "sofa" or "couch" for the past few years. Basically, she had always had the nickname "sofa" and I had started thinking of couches when I hear it, so I started calling her "couch" for fun. One day, I added the couch emoji next to the word "couch" in a text, and she went, "well guess what aadya, since ur so tall ur the lamp next to the couch!" We both started laughing so hard, because it was so true. Me (5'11'') standing next to her (5'2'') literally embodied that emoji. From then on, I have been called "lamp" and live in harmony with my "couch" in that emoji.</p>

      <p class="list">2. Gorilla Sitter</p>
      <div class="intro">
        <div class="item1">
          <p>When creating a post for Hello World HQ, Sarada asked me to send her a picture of me. I literally had no good pictures, so I sent this one because she said everyone elese was doing a full body picture. (TURNS OUT SHE WAS CONSPIRING AGAINST ME AND NOW I LOOK WEIRD IN THE POST.) Anyways, she jokingly called me "gorilla sitter" and all of us (the directors of Hello World HQ) started dying of laughter. Now, whenever any member has to summon me or just refer to me in general, I am known as the "gorilla sitter" and I always respond to that.</p>

      <p class="list">3. Paadya</p>
      <div class="intro">
        <div class="item1">
          <p>This one came from another short friend named Neha. She knows basic Hindi, and one day we were just casually talking in Hindi at school to try and practice. This genius decided to merge the word "paad" and my name together. For reference, "paad" means fart in Hindi. Now, I'm sometimes called "paadya" by her and we find it so funny with our broken humor. I did get her back, though, adding "paad" to her last name. Instead of Deshpande, she is now "Deshpaade" to me. ("Deshpaade" is extra funny, because "desh" means country in Hindi, so essentialy she is a "country of farts")</p>
